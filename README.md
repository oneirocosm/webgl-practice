# WebGL Practice

I've previously looked into [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), but I never put a ton of effort into it. I now have the chance to go through it with a larger group of people, and I'd like to create a central place to keep my work.

This site is made with astro just to keep things flexible down the line.  Maybe that will end up being a mistake, but I've been happy with astro in the past.

At the moment, this is just a starter astro template with some example files, so I will need to clean that out in the meantime.
